            When an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to
            make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries,
            but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially
            unchanged.

            Ever since I can remember I loved to learn. I was thrilled to learn
            absolutely anything, I just wanted to know how things worked and how
            they were built. When I was promoted to production manager it felt
            as if I unlocked a whole new level of things to learn. It was so
            satisfying to gain knowledge and understanding of something I
            thought i never would. Thats why I have decided to be a software
            engineer! I have learned the fundamentals and I know I have only
            scratched the surface.
